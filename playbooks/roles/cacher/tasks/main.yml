# We should install devpi as a system process, so that it starts
# during system reboot (in /etc/rcX.d/...). However, for some reason
# that doesn't work, the process tries to start, but immediately fails
# and finally is given up on (messages in /var/log/dmesg). Therefore,
# we use the less ideal approach and start the service once a minute
# via cron.
#
# If the system process problem could be solved, we should switch
# to that approach.

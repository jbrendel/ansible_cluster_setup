# Actions on the localhost: Bring up EC2 instances and add to our groups
#

---
#
# This playbook runs actions not on some remote server, but on the local
# host on which Ansible is running. It uses the "ec2" module to dynamically
# create hosts.

  tasks:
    #
    # Using the "ec2" module, we create some number of hosts. All those
    # variables here just specify the parameters, access keys, image types,
    # and so on.
    #
    # The module returns references to all the created instances. We remember
    # ("register") them in the variable "ec2results".
    #
    - name: launch ec2 instances

    #
    # Now we dynamically add all those hosts ("with items: # ec2results.instances")
    # to the group, for whose name we just chose the EC2-region name. Since EC2
    # uses different SSH keys (and possibly even security groups) in different
    # regions, it is useful to have these hosts in a region-specific group.
    # That allows us to specify a variable file with the region-sepecific
    # settings.
    #

    # We take one (the first) of those machines to populate the frontend group.
    # I'm makeing sure to define the anible_ssh_host variable for this host,
    # since we will need that variable much later, when we fill in the load
    # balancing group in the nginx config file.
